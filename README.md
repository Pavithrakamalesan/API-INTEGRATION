**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

**Title**: Weather Search Application

**Overview**

The Weather Search Application is a responsive web app that allows users to search for real-time weather data by city. It fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays details like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

**Features**

1.Search Functionality: Users can search weather data for any city.

2.Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across devices.

3.Dynamic Data Loading: Real-time updates without page reloads.

4.Error Handling: Displays messages for invalid inputs or API errors.

**Technologies Used**

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end development.
- OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data.

**How It Works**

1.The user enters a city name into the search bar and clicks the "Search" button.

2.A request is sent to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data for the specified city.

3.The weather data is dynamically displayed on the webpage, including:
- City name
- Current temperature in Celsius
- Humidity percentage
- Weather description (e.g., "clear sky").
  
4.If an error occurs (e.g., city not found), a relevant message is displayed.

**Future Enhancements**

-Add weather forecasts.

-Include geolocation-based weather fetching.
